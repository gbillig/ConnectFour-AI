# ConnectFour-AI

This project recreates the classic Connect Four game between two players. The primary goal of this project was to implement an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that will act as a player for the game Connect Four.

The AI is designed to use the minimax algorithm in coordination with a heuristic function. The minimax algorithm is used to explore possible future moves. Each of these potential scenarios is evaluated with the heuristic function and will be assigned a score. Using these two key concepts, the AI is able to smarly choose his next move. For more specific implementation details, check out the How It Works section!

Give it try, see if you're able to defeat the AI!
